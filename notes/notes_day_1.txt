Kate had mentioned to keep in mind possible points of
failure for a distributed systems app. Here are some
set forth by http://jan.newmarch.name/go/arch/chapter-arch.html

-The client side can crash
-Client system hardware problems
-Network card problems
-Network contention can cause timeouts
-Address conflicts
-Client and server versions are incompatible
-Server hw or sw problems

Falacies of distributed computing
-Network is reliable
-Latency is zero
-Bandwidth is infinite
-Network is secure
-Transport cost is zero
-Network is homogenous
