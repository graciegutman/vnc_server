SERVER BASICS
A server registers itself on a port and listens. It blocks on an "accept"
operation (program stops and waits on the accept operation). When a client
connects, the accept call returns with a connection object. 

A daytime server waits for a connection, writs the current time to the client
and then closes the connection and resumes waiting.

relevant calls are:

func ListenTCP(net string, laddr *TCPAddr) (1, *TCPListener, err os.Error)
func (l *TCPListener) Accept() (c Conn, err os.Error)

The first takes a network net, and a local TCPAddress to listen on
The latter is a method called on a TCPListener that "accepts" a request
and returns a Conn interface.*/
